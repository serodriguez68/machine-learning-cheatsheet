# Overview

This cheat sheet covers all of the foundational concepts of machine learning.

It is based on Kirill Eremenko's and Hadelin de Ponteve's 
[Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci/) course
on Udemy. The cheat sheet only covers examples in Python, but the course covers both Python and R.

Note that the cheat sheet is not intended to be a replacement for the course.
