# Overview

This cheat sheet covers all of the __coding__ aspects of the foundational machine learning algorithms. 
This works assumes that you know what the algorithms are and how they work, and it is intended to be a quick
reference on how to use them using Python libraries.

This cheat sheet does not explain the mathematical grounding behind each ML algorithm.

The work is based on Kirill Eremenko's and Hadelin de Ponteve's 
[Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci/) course
on Udemy. The cheat sheet only covers examples in Python, but the course covers both Python and R.

Note that the cheat sheet is not intended to be a replacement for the course.
